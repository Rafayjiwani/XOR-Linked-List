# XOR-Linked-List:
A common Doubly Linked List requires space for two location fields to store the addresses of past and next nodes. A memory efficient of Doubly Linked List can be made utilizing just one space for address field with each node. This memory effective Doubly Linked List is called XOR Linked List or Memory Efficient as the rundown utilizes bitwise XOR activity to spare space for one location. In the XOR connected rundown, rather than putting away real memory addresses, each node stores the XOR of addresses of past and next node.

# Problem In Python:
If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses which are the functions of C++ or C language

# Functions:
1) insert or add
2) print or get
